#Day-01
I have built a lightweight and customizable text tokenizer that converts text into numerical representations and vice versa. This tokenizer supports special tokens, handles unknown words, and ensures proper spacing in decoded text.
Features:
Tokenization: Splits text into words and punctuation.
Encoding: Converts text into numerical token IDs.
Decoding: Converts token IDs back into text with proper formatting.
Unknown Token Handling: Replaces out-of-vocabulary words with <|unk|>
